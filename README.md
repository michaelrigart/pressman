# Pressman

Pressman is an experimental, multi-format e-book generator. It takes textile files and converts them to multiple e-book formats.

Pressman is still experimental and I wouldn't advice anyone on using it in a production environment! It's all hacked together
for a little proof of concept.

## Installation

Install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pressman
